# Te Whare Piringa Booking System

Te Whare Piringa needed a booking system for its hall that would allow members of the community to see what times the hall was available to be booked and what times had already been booked.  This was driven by a need for members to be able to book times themselves directly (which should reduce double booking mistakes) and see what times the hall was booked without also seeing who held the booking.

## Dev Environment Setup

Be sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
